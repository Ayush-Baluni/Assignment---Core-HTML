    <p>
        In HTML, tags are words or letters surrounded by angle brackets(< and >). Tags are used to initialize/create 
        elements, such as a paagraph, heading, image, hyperlink, etc. <br> There are various tags in HTML, which are as
        follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>html tag -</b> It starts with '&lthtml&gt' and ends with '&lt/html&gt'. This is the container of every 
                thing in the webpage except '&lt!DOCTYPE&gt' tag. This tag is also called the root of the webpage. This 
                tag is fundamental to creating any HTML document, as it encompasses the entire structure and content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>head tag -</b> It starts with '&lthead&gt' and ends with '&lt/head&gt'. The head element contains the 
                meta-information about the webpage, not the content. Elements like title, link, meta. etc. can be put inside the
                head tag. The content within the <head> tag does not appear directly on the web page, but it is crucial for 
                defining how the document is processed and displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>title tag -</b> The title element contains the title of the page. The title is displayed in the browserâ€™s 
                title bar (the bar at the top of the browser window), as well as in bookmarks, search engine results, and many 
                other places. It starts with a '&lttitle&gt' tag and ends with a '&lt/title&gt' tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>body tag -</b> It starts with '&ltbody&gt' and ends with '&lt/body&gt'. The body element appears after 
                the head element in the page. It should contain all the content of your web page: text, images, and so on. 
                All web pages have 1 single body element, with the exception of frameset pages, which contain frame elements 
                instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>heading tag -</b> It starts with '&lth1&gt' and ends with '&lt/h1&gt'. Heading tags go from h1 - h6 depending 
                upon what size you want your heading to be. The tag format remains the same in all except the number. These tags 
                are important for structuring the content of a web page, making it easier for users to read and for search engines 
                to index.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>paragraph tag -</b> It starts with '&ltp&gt' and ends with '&l/p&gt'. This element lets you create paragraphs of
                text. It is a block-level element so it always starts on a new line and the browsers automatically add some margin
                before and after the element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>anchor tag -</b> It starts with '&lta' and ends with '&lt/a&gt'. 'href' is the attribute of the tag that
                contains the URL you want to link in the anchor tag. It is one of the most important elements in a web page, as
                it lets you create links to other content like sites, images, references, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>image tag -</b> It starts with '&ltimg' and ends with '&gt'. It is a self closing that that  ets you insert 
                images into your web pages. To insert an image, you first upload the image to your web server, then use the 'src' 
                attribute to reference the image filename. The 'alt' attribute is required to display text in the place of images
                in case the browser can't display the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>div tag -</b> This is a container element that you can use to add more structure to your page content. For example, 
                you can group several lines or paragraphs, even headings in a div. These are typically used for headers and footers,
                sidebars, image galleries, etc. It starts with '&ltdiv&gt' and ends with '&lt/div&gt'. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>table tag -</b> This element is used to create a table in HTML and it starts with '&lttable&gt', while ending with
                '&lt/table&gt'. It consists of several other tags as well; '&lttr&gt' defines a row in the table, '&ltth&gt' defines
                the table header or the topmost row, and '&lttd&gt' defines the elements in the rest of the rows. There are many other
                tags in table to merge, align, space and do much more with the cells and the data in the cells. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>list tag -</b> There are two lists, both of which remain almost the same in format. For unordered lists, the tag is
                '&ltul&gt' and for ordered lists the tag is '&ltol&gt'. In unordered lists there are icons as the points in list, such 
                as bullets, squares, etc. while for ordered list there are numbers, roman numerals, alphabets, etc. To initialize an 
                item, '&ltli&gt' tag must be used which ends with '&lt/li&gt'.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    Apart from these, there are text tags such as:
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <b>bold tag</b> (&ltb&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>italic tag</i> (&lti&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <mark>highlighting tag</mark> (&ltmark&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <del>strike-through</del> tag (&ltdel&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>underline tag</u> (&ltu&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <sup>superscript tag</sup>(&ltsup&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <sub>subscript tag</sub> (&ltsub&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <small>small tag</small> (&ltsmall&gt)
        </li>
        <li>
            <big>big tag</big> (&ltbig&gt)
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    The format for all remains the same, with a front slash on the ending tag.
