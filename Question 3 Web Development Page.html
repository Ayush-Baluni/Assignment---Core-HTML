    <p>
        Web-Development refers to the task of creating, building, maintaing various sorts of websites and
        web applications that can run on a browser. Learning Web-Development requires learning web design, 
        web programming, and also managing databases.

    <p>
        Web-Development has two parts:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Front-End Web Development -</b> This part includes the part of websites and applications that 
                are visible to the user, that the user can interact with. This includes mastering HTML 
                (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). By using HTML we can make the
                structure of a web page. And CSS helps in improving the eye-catchiness and the interface of
                the page. By mastering these two, one can work front-end jobs that require maintaining and also
                building the user interface from the scratch. Though nowadays there does not seem to be as much
                demand for front-end engineers only. That bring us to the next one:
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Back-End Web Development -</b> This includes everything aside from the looks and feels of the
                site. HTML and CSS help the site look good visually while Back-End developers handle all the back
                frame work of the website or the application. It uses technology like JavaScript with various other
                frameworks on top of it. It includes tech like React, MongoDB, Exprexx, NodeJS. Using all of this 
                one can handle the working of a website or an application.
            </li>
        </ul>

        And when learned both, he could be called a <b>Full Stack
        Developer</b>.
