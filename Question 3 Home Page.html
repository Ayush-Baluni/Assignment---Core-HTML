    <p>Hello, everyone. I am Ayush and I welcome you all to my blog.</p>
    
    <p>I am a student at Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun in the state of Uttarakhand. Currently, I am pursuing BCA 
    (Bachelors of Computer Applications). I have always been interested in programming since I was a child, especially making
    entire websites and applications. But couldn't bring myself to commit to start it. Now that I am a student and have some
    garnered some knowledge about programming, my goal is to become a MERN Stack Web Developer.</p>

    <p>
        My skills in programming, though not much, include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                C Language
            </li>
            <li>
                C++ Language
            </li>
            <li>
                Python Language
            </li>
        </ul>

        The skills are intermediate+. It does help in building a good base for me. Helps in learning new languages and new concepts better.
    </p>

    <p>
