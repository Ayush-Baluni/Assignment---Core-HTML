    <p>
        Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of
        website development rather than software development. It is the process of planning, conceptualizing,
        and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user
        experience. User experience is central to web design. It encompasses making the website pleasing to
        look at, making it easy to navigate, ease of access to essential features and making the site very
        efficient.

        Web designers are the ones that create the design and layout of a website with their knowledge and
        skills. To become a web designer one must have deep understanding of UI (User Inferface) and UX (User
        Experience) and must be experienced with programs to make design elements. Programs like Adobe, Inkscape,
        CorelDraw are used to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, etc.
